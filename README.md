# r_drugsales

## Description

This is a script designed to be a versatile way for players in your server to sell the drugs they farm/craft. The script was born out of the necessity to address issues encountered with similar scripts, and to give players an ability to choose how they sell their drugs. Players can either choose to sell to peds on the street, which can pay more but with increased risk of police attention. Then there's selling in bulk, which requires a configurable amount of drugs, and will give players a spot to meet a ped and handle the exchange, but for less than what they would make on the street. I hope you guys enjoy this resource as much as I did working on it.
